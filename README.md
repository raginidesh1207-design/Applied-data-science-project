#Project: Sales Analysis (Applied Data Science with Python)
This project focuses on analyzing fourth-quarter sales data for AAL, an Australian apparel brand.
The goal was to identify high- and low-performing states, study demographic and time-based sales patterns, and present insights through visualizations and reports.

#The analysis includes:
Cleaning and normalizing sales data

Performing descriptive statistics using Pandas, NumPy, and SciPy

Visualizing key trends with Seaborn and Matplotlib

Creating dashboards and generating reports in Jupyter Notebook

This project demonstrates practical data science skills — from wrangling and analysis to visualization and insight generation — for real-world business decision-making.
